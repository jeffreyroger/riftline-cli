# Riftline

Know what breaks before you break it.

Riftline parses a Python package into a dependency graph — who calls whom,
resolved across files — so you can ask "if I change function X, what's the
full blast radius?" before you touch it.

## What's actually here (Week 1 deliverable)

- `riftline/parser.py` — parses each file, extracts its import table and
  every function's raw calls.
- `riftline/resolver.py` — chains a file's import table with every other
  file's symbol table to turn raw call names into resolved, fully-qualified
  edges. Anything it can't verify is flagged `unresolved`, never guessed.
- `riftline/graph.py` — scans a whole package, builds a `networkx.DiGraph`,
  and answers blast-radius queries via `nx.ancestors`.
- `riftline/cli.py` — the actual `riftline` command.
- `fixtures/mini_pkg/` — a 4-file chain (`app → main → utils → core`) plus
  one deliberately unresolved call, used by the tests and as a live demo.
- `tests/test_graph.py` — 7 regression tests, all passing.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -e .
riftline scan fixtures
riftline hotspots fixtures
riftline impact low_level --path fixtures
```

`riftline impact` no longer requires the exact dotted path — `low_level`
auto-resolves to `mini_pkg.core.low_level` if it's unambiguous. If a short
name matches more than one function, it lists every match instead of
guessing:

```
'transform' is ambiguous -- 2 functions match:
  - mypkg.extra.other.transform
  - mypkg.processing.transformers.transform
Re-run with one of the full names above.
```

`riftline hotspots` is the "no symbol name needed" entry point — it ranks
every function by blast-radius size, so you can see your riskiest
chokepoints before you even know what to ask about:

```
Top 4 riskiest functions in fixtures (by blast-radius size):
  mini_pkg.core.low_level   3 dependent(s)
  mini_pkg.utils.helper     2 dependent(s)
  mini_pkg.main.foo         1 dependent(s)
```

`core.low_level` is 3 hops deep — `app.run` has no direct import of `core`
at all — but the graph traces the full chain anyway.

## Known substitutions (read before continuing the build)

This sandbox has no network access, so two dependencies from the original
plan were swapped for stdlib equivalents. Both are drop-in replacements
scoped to a single file each:

| Planned | Used instead | Swap scope |
|---|---|---|
| `tree-sitter` (multi-language AST) | `ast` (stdlib, Python-only) | `parser.py` only |
| `typer` + `rich` (CLI/output) | `argparse` + `print` (stdlib) | `cli.py` only |
| `pytest` | `unittest` (stdlib) | `tests/test_graph.py` only |

Nothing about `resolver.py` or `graph.py` — the actual hard part — depends
on any of these. Once you have network access, `pip install tree-sitter
tree-sitter-python typer rich pytest` and swap those three files; the
graph/resolution logic doesn't change.

## Known limitations (by design, not oversight)

- **Bare-name calls only.** `foo(x)` resolves; `h.process(x)` does not —
  verifying an attribute exists on an imported symbol needs type inference,
  which is out of scope for V1. Attribute calls are currently left
  unresolved rather than guessed at. This is the single highest-value
  extension for Week 2.
- **No git diff integration yet.** `riftline diff` is a stub. `graph.py`
  already has `function_at_line()` ready for it — git diff gives you
  changed line numbers, and every function's line span was already
  extracted in `parser.py`, so this is mostly wiring, not new design.
- **Single-package scope.** Cross-package resolution (calls into installed
  third-party libraries) is intentionally out of scope — those always
  resolve as `unknown:<name>`, which is correct behavior, not a bug.

## What's next (Week 2+, per the implementation plan)

1. Class/method call resolution (`self.foo()`, `instance.method()`)
2. `git diff` → changed lines → affected functions (wire up
   `function_at_line`)
3. Test-file mapping (affected function → likely test file via naming
   convention)
4. Mermaid/Graphviz export of the dependency graph
5. Confidence-rate benchmark on a real multi-hundred-file repo
